# final-year-project

For my final project to earn my BSc, I researched E-Commerce and how it applies persuasion to motivate users to purchase more. I looked to implement three major things:
- A review system that allowed only verified purchases.
- A messaging system allowing users to reach out to others who left reviews to ask for more information.
- A collaborative filtering algorithm that used preferences provided at signup to tailor the products recommended to the user.

By building on an existing e-commerce project, i was able to implement these features and earn an A grade.
